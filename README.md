ICE Studio is the **development and interaction environment** of the ICE
ecosystem.

It provides a graphical interface and integration layer for interacting with
ICE runtimes, agents, plugins, and services during development and experimentation.

ICE Studio is currently under **active refactoring**.
Its structure, scope, and responsibilities are evolving.

---

## Purpose

ICE Studio exists to:

- Provide a graphical workspace for ICE systems
- Integrate runtimes, agents, and services
- Support experimentation, debugging, and iteration
- Host plugins, panels, and UI extensions
- Act as the primary developer-facing environment

This repository does not yet represent a finalized product.

---

## Scope

Current and planned areas include:

- Electron-based desktop application
- Runtime and agent integration
- Plugin and extension system
- IPC and backend coordination
- Layout, panels, and workspace management
- Experimental UI flows and prototypes

The internal structure is expected to change significantly.

---

## Design Notes

- APIs are not stable
- UI and architecture are subject to refactor
- Components may be moved or rewritten
- Backward compatibility is not guaranteed

This repository prioritizes **iteration speed over stability**.

---

## Usage

ICE Studio is intended for **development and internal use**.

It interacts with:
- ICE Runtime
- ICE Engine
- ICE AI
- ICE API
- ICE Protocols

End-user distribution and packaging are **out of scope** at this stage.

---

## Status

This project is under **active development and refactoring**.
Consider all functionality experimental.

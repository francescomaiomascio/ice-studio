# ICE Studio
## Interactive Development Environment for the ICE Ecosystem

ICE Studio is the **primary interaction and development environment**
of the ICE ecosystem.

It provides a **unified workspace** to observe, interact with, and operate
ICE systems during development, experimentation, and controlled execution.

ICE Studio is not the system.
It is the **interface through which the system is understood and used**.

---

## Position in the ICE Ecosystem

ICE Studio is a **downstream product layer**.

- Conceptual authority is defined by **ICE Foundation**
- Execution and enforcement are handled by **ICE Runtime / Engine**
- Intelligence and cognition are supplied by **ICE AI** and **ICE Consciousness**
- Interaction contracts are defined by **ICE API** and **ICE Protocols**

ICE Studio does not redefine meaning.
It exposes it.

---

## Purpose

ICE Studio exists to:

- provide a coherent workspace for ICE systems
- make execution, state, and decisions observable
- support development, debugging, and iteration
- integrate agents, runtimes, and services
- host panels, plugins, and UI extensions
- act as the primary developer-facing surface of ICE

ICE Studio is where ICE becomes *usable*.

---

## What ICE Studio Is

ICE Studio is:

- an **interactive control surface**
- a **development environment**
- a **visual integration layer**
- a **tool for exploration and validation**
- a **gateway to ICE systems**

It allows humans to interact with ICE
without weakening its constraints.

---

## What ICE Studio Is Not

ICE Studio is **not**:

- an authority layer
- an execution engine
- an intelligence system
- a substitute for Runtime or Engine
- a place where rules are defined

The UI does not decide.
The UI does not execute.
The UI does not authorize.

---

## Scope

Current and planned areas include:

- desktop application (Electron or equivalent)
- runtime and agent integration
- plugin and extension architecture
- IPC and backend coordination
- workspace, layout, and panel management
- visualization of state, events, and decisions
- experimental UI flows and prototypes

Structure and scope are expected to evolve.

---

## Stability and Evolution

ICE Studio is intentionally **iterative**.

- APIs are not yet stable
- UI structure may change
- components may be rewritten
- backward compatibility is not guaranteed

This is expected.

ICE Studio evolves faster than core ICE domains,
by design.

---

## Usage

ICE Studio is intended for:

- ICE developers
- system designers
- experimentation and exploration
- controlled operation of ICE systems

It interacts with:

- ICE Runtime
- ICE Engine
- ICE AI
- ICE Consciousness
- ICE API
- ICE Protocols

End-user distribution is **not** a goal at this stage.

---

## Canonical Status

ICE Studio is **non-authoritative**.

If ICE Studio were removed,
the ICE ecosystem would remain conceptually intact.

ICE Studio exists to make ICE *usable*, not *true*.

---

## Status

ICE Studio is under **active development and refactoring**.

Expect change.

---

## Notes

ICE can exist without a UI.

But a serious system  
needs a place where humans can face it.
